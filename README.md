# Statistical-Inference-Project

## Synopsis
This is a project for the Coursera Statistical Inference Class. The project consists of two parts:
- Simulation Exercise to explore inference
- Basic inferential analysis using the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package

## Part 1 - Simulation Exercise
### Overview
Investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations.

### Instructions
Illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials.
- Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
- Show how variable the sample is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
- Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

## Part 2 - Inferential Analysis using ToothGrowth data
### Overview
Analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

### Instructions
Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analysis
- Provide a basic summary of the data
- Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose
- State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions
